This is the repository for the discord bot which runs in the VTOL VR Modding discord server. The bot is created in Python and using [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Installation 

You'll need Python 3.6 or higher installed and the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) module downloaded.
Once you have cloned the repository to your local files. You need to create a text document called BotData.txt where it contains the information like the token, general channel and the welcome channels id's.

BotData.txt Example:

    TOKEN=YOUTOKEN
    WELCOME=123456789
The script checks the line, if it contains one of the three variables it needs to fill, then everything else on that line gets used as the variable.
